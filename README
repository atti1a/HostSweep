# Host Sweep

A Burp plugin to test URLs and see if they are vulnerable to Host header
poisoning. This vulnerability is mostly harmless actually, but it's usually a
good indicator of other issues in a code base.

Also a first crack at writing Burp extensions, and a genesis of possible ideas
for a Burp Extender utilities library.
